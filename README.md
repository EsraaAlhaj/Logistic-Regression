# Logistic-Regression
 Profitable Ordersâ€™ Drivers
  I will predict the profitability of our chocolate orders. by  useing  Logistic Regression to analyze the sales data and make predictions about the profitability of future orders. The problem I am trying to solve is to help the sales team understand which orders are more likely to be profitable and which ones are not, so they can make better decisions on which orders to accept and which ones to decline.

The project will involve several stages, including data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation. I will start by cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, including removing missing values, handling outliers, and transforming variables as needed. Then, I will use Logistic Regression to build a predictive model that can accurately classify orders as profitable or unprofitable based on their features.

Once the model is built, I will evaluate its performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. I will also perform feature selection and interpret the coefficients of the model to identify the most important factors that contribute to profitability.
